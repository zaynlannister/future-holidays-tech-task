### Lazy loading for perfomance quality

- In this project, I used one of the techniques called "lazy loading." With lazy loading, a webpage loads gradually, prioritizing essential content and deferring non-essential elements, like videos, until the user interacts with them by scrolling. By employing lazy loading specifically for autoplay videos, the performance benefits are significant. The webpage initially loads faster, enhancing user experience by minimizing wait times. This optimization not only improves SEO by boosting page speed but also increases conversion rates as visitors are more likely to engage with the faster-loading content. Honestly it was my first time creating somthing using this technique!
